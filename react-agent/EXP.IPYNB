For example, to calculate the answer to the first question, you can use the following code:\n`print(numexpr.evaluate(\"37593 * 67\"))`\nWhich will output `2518731`.",

Here are the steps for each problem:\n1. What is 37593 * 67?\nExpression: `37593 * 67`\nPython Code: `numexpr.evaluate(\"37593 * 67\")`\nOutput: `2518731`\n2. 37593^(1/5)\nExpression: `37593**(1/5)`\nPython Code: `numexpr.evaluate(\"37593**(1/5)\")`\nOutput: `8.22831614237718`\n3. 4**2.1\n\nExpression: `4**2.1`\n\nPython Code: `numexpr.evaluate(\"4**2.1\")`\nOutput: `16.5`\n\nNow, you can use these expressions to calculate the answers to the questions. For example, to calculate the answer to the first question, you can use the following code:\n`print(numexpr.evaluate(\"37593 * 67\"))`\nWhich will output `2518731`."
